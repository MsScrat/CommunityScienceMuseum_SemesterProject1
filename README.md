## Description 

### Task and idea

The task was to create a website for a child-friendly museum.  
My idea was to use images with kids and implement color. 

## Result
At the time, I was super happy with the design, but looking back I see so many improvements to be made.  
This shows progress and it is really happy with that at least!
